/**
 * Windows reopen fix — cross-process evidence (#2274 / PR #2313).
 *
 * The RO bridge-handle cache exists to fix a Windows-specific failure: in a
 * long-lived MCP serve process, repeated `@group` calls used to reopen
 * `bridge.lbug` per call, and the in-process reopen fails on Windows. The cache
 * keeps ONE handle alive and reuses it, so there is no reopen.
 *
 * The unit-test cache cases all begin with an in-process `writeBridge` →
 * read-only open (the unfixed write→read reopen), so they are win32-skipped and
 * cannot prove the fix on the target platform. THIS test seeds `bridge.lbug` in
 * a SEPARATE process (so the writable handle is fully released before we open
 * read-only), making the first RO open a clean cross-process open. It therefore
 * runs on win32 CI and proves the load-bearing property: a second/third
 * `getCachedBridgeReadOnly` returns the SAME handle with no reopen.
