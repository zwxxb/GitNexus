Returns a page of repositories — each with name, path, indexed date, last commit, and stats — plus a "pagination" object: { total, limit, offset, returned, hasMore, nextOffset }.

PAGINATION: Results are paginated so a large registry is not truncated by MCP/LLM token limits. "limit" sets the page size (default ${LIST_REPOS_DEFAULT_LIMIT}, max ${LIST_REPOS_MAX_LIMIT}; values above the max are rejected, not capped). "offset" selects the start. To enumerate EVERY repository: when pagination.hasMore is true, call list_repos again with offset set to pagination.nextOffset, and repeat until hasMore is false. Repositories are returned in a stable order, so paging never skips or duplicates an entry while the registry is unchanged.

WHEN TO USE: First step when multiple repos are indexed, or to discover available repos.
AFTER THIS: READ gitnexus://repo/{name}/context for the repo you want to work with.

When multiple repos are indexed, you MUST specify the "repo" parameter

WHEN TO USE: Understanding how code works together. Use this when you need execution flows and relationships, not just file matches. Complements grep/IDE search.
AFTER THIS: Use context() on a specific symbol for 360-degree view (callers, callees, categorized refs).

Returns results grouped by process (execution flow):

Hybrid ranking: BM25 keyword + semantic vector search, ranked by Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

WHEN TO USE: Complex structural queries that search/explore can't answer. READ gitnexus://repo/{name}/schema first for the full schema.
AFTER THIS: Use context() on result symbols for deeper context.

SCHEMA:
- Nodes: File, Folder, Function, Class, Interface, Method, CodeElement, Community, Process, Route, Tool
- Multi-language nodes (use backticks): \`Struct\`, \`Enum\`, \`Trait\`, \`Impl\`, etc.
- All edges via single CodeRelation table with 'type' property
- Edge types: CONTAINS, DEFINES, CALLS, IMPORTS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS, HAS_METHOD, HAS_PROPERTY, ACCESSES, METHOD_OVERRIDES, METHOD_IMPLEMENTS, MEMBER_OF, STEP_IN_PROCESS, HANDLES_ROUTE, FETCHES, HANDLES_TOOL, ENTRY_POINT_OF
- Edge properties: type (STRING), confidence (DOUBLE), reason (STRING), step (INT32)

EXAMPLES:
• Find callers of a function:
  MATCH (a)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'CALLS'}]->(b:Function {name: "validateUser"}) RETURN a.name, a.filePath

• Find community members:
  MATCH (f)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'MEMBER_OF'}]->(c:Community) WHERE c.heuristicLabel = "Auth" RETURN f.name

• Trace a process:
  MATCH (s)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'STEP_IN_PROCESS'}]->(p:Process) WHERE p.heuristicLabel = "UserLogin" RETURN s.name, r.step ORDER BY r.step

• Find all methods of a class:
  MATCH (c:Class {name: "UserService"})-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'HAS_METHOD'}]->(m:Method) RETURN m.name, m.parameterCount, m.returnType

• Find all properties of a class:
  MATCH (c:Class {name: "User"})-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'HAS_PROPERTY'}]->(p:Property) RETURN p.name, p.declaredType

• Find all writers of a field:
  MATCH (f:Function)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'ACCESSES', reason: 'write'}]->(p:Property) WHERE p.name = "address" RETURN f.name, f.filePath

• Find method overrides (MRO resolution):
  MATCH (winner:Method)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'METHOD_OVERRIDES'}]->(loser:Method) RETURN winner.name, winner.filePath, loser.filePath, r.reason

• Detect diamond inheritance:
  MATCH (d:Class)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(b1), (d)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(b2), (b1)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(a), (b2)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(a) WHERE b1 <> b2 RETURN d.name, b1.name, b2.name, a.name

OUTPUT: Returns { markdown, row_count } — results formatted as a Markdown table for easy reading.

TIPS:
- All relationships use single CodeRelation table — filter with {type: 'CALLS'} etc.
- Community = auto-detected functional area (Leiden algorithm). Properties: heuristicLabel, cohesion, symbolCount, keywords, description, enrichedBy
- Process = execution flow trace from entry point to terminal. Properties: heuristicLabel, processType, stepCount, communities, entryPointId, terminalId
- Use heuristicLabel (not label) for human-readable community/process names
- PDG layers (only when indexed with \`--pdg\`): BasicBlock nodes + CFG / CDG (control dependence, branch sense 'T'|'F' in reason) / REACHING_DEF (def→use, variable in reason) edges, all BasicBlock→BasicBlock. Prefer the \`pdg_query\` tool — it anchors + bounds these for you (raw \`[:CDG*]\`/\`[:REACHING_DEF*]\` path scans are unindexed and unbounded).`,

NOTE: ACCESSES edges (field read/write tracking) are included in context results with reason 'read' or 'write'. CALLS edges resolve through field access chains and method-call chains (e.g., user.address.getCity().save() produces CALLS edges at each step).

Returns affected symbols grouped by depth, plus risk assessment, affected execution flows, and affected modules.

MODE (opt-in): "callgraph" (default) walks symbol→symbol edges (CALLS/IMPORTS/EXTENDS/IMPLEMENTS) — inter-procedural, the established comparator/default behavior. "pdg" requires an index built with \`gitnexus analyze --pdg\` and returns one unified PDG-facing result: statement-level control/data dependence from the persisted PDG plus inter-procedural symbol reach. The explicit interprocedural surface is interproceduralByDepth/pdgInterprocedural; byDepth remains the compatibility symbol bucket. pdg remains incompatible with crossDepth and @group targets; relationTypes/minConfidence filter the inter-symbol reach.

STATEMENT-ANCHORED PDG SLICE: with mode:'pdg', pass "line" (1-based source line within the target symbol) to seed the dependence slice on the statement at that line and return what depends on it in affectedStatements (line + text). Inter-procedural symbols are still reported through interproceduralByDepth/pdgInterprocedural and the compatibility byDepth bucket. Without "line", pdg returns whole-symbol inter-procedural reach plus local whole-symbol PDG diagnostics.

PDG OUTPUT CONTRACT: every mode:'pdg' result (success, empty, degraded, or error) carries pdgResultVersion:1 — a stable discriminator for external consumers that bumps on any breaking change to the PDG result shape (distinct from the DB schema version). Successful PDG results include mode:'pdg', a full target envelope (id/name/type/filePath), affectedStatements, affectedStatementCount, interproceduralByDepth/pdgInterprocedural for cross-function reach, compatibility byDepth/byDepthCounts, risk:'UNKNOWN', and a note describing the unified contract. Degraded PDG results (no-layer, sub-layer-missing, unknown) keep mode:'pdg', pdgResultVersion:1, target metadata when the target resolves, risk:'UNKNOWN', note/remediation, and empty byDepth parity fields — never a false-safe zero. If depth and limit both bound the slice, truncatedByReasons reports both causes while truncatedBy remains scalar.

WHEN TO USE: Before making code changes — especially refactoring, renaming, or modifying shared code. Shows what would break.
AFTER THIS: Review d=1 items (WILL BREAK). Use context() on high-risk symbols.

Output includes:
- risk: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL / UNKNOWN
- summary: direct callers, processes affected, modules affected
- affected_processes: which execution flows break and at which step
- affected_modules: which functional areas are hit (direct vs indirect)
- byDepth: affected symbols grouped by traversal depth (paginated by limit/offset; omitted when summaryOnly:true — use byDepthCounts for totals per depth, pagination object when truncated). Each item includes a processes:[{id,label,processType,step}] field listing the execution flows that symbol participates in. Empty when the symbol has no process membership. Can ALSO be empty when partial:true is set — either the process-aggregation pass hit its cap before detecting affected processes, or per-symbol enrichment was capped on a very large page. When partial:true, do NOT treat processes:[] as proof of no participation; cross-check the top-level affected_processes list.

Depth groups:
- d=1: WILL BREAK (direct callers/importers)
- d=2: LIKELY AFFECTED (indirect)
- d=3: MAY NEED TESTING (transitive)

TIP: For hub symbols (base error classes, shared utilities) with many direct callers, use summaryOnly: true first to see counts and risk, then drill into specific depths with limit/offset. maxDepth alone does not bound output size when most dependents are at depth 1. limit and offset apply independently to each depth level, not to the total result set — use byDepthCounts to see totals per depth.

TIP: Default traversal uses CALLS/IMPORTS/EXTENDS/IMPLEMENTS. For class members, include HAS_METHOD and HAS_PROPERTY in relationTypes. For field access analysis, include ACCESSES in relationTypes.

Handles disambiguation: when multiple symbols share the target name, returns ranked candidates (each with a relevance score) instead of silently picking one. Use target_uid for zero-ambiguity lookup, or narrow with file_path and/or kind hints.

    description: `Explain persisted taint findings recorded by \`gitnexus analyze --pdg\`: intra-procedural source→sink data flows (TAINTED edges, statement-level hops) AND cross-function flows (TAINT_PATH edges, function-level hops, marked \`interprocedural: true\`).

Each finding carries the sink category (command-injection, code-injection, path-traversal, sql-injection, xss) and the ordered hop path. Intra-procedural findings carry source/sink lines and the variable on each hop; interprocedural findings carry the source and sink FUNCTION names and the chain of functions the taint crossed (decoded from the persisted path encoding).

WHEN TO USE: Security review — "what taint findings exist in this repo / file / function?". Requires the repo to be indexed with \`gitnexus analyze --pdg\`; without that layer the tool returns a clear "no taint layer" note, not an error.

ANCHORLESS (no "target"): enumerates all persisted findings for the repo — bounded ("limit", deterministic order), with "totalFindings" and a "truncated" flag.
ANCHORED ("target" = file path or symbol/function name): full hop detail for that anchor. A file-ish target (contains "/" or an extension) filters by file; a symbol name resolves like context() — ambiguous names return ranked candidates, unknown names return not-found. Symbol anchoring is line-range granular for intra-procedural findings; cross-function findings match when the symbol is the source OR sink function.

CONTRACT CAVEATS (absent flows are NOT proof of safety):
- Cross-function flows ARE modeled (#2084 M4): a source flowing through helper functions into a sink is found, via summary composition over the call graph (context-insensitive — return/call-site merging is accepted).
- Cross-function matching is by callee NAME (context-insensitive): when one caller invokes two distinct same-named callees, a flow into one over-attributes to both — a cross-function finding does not prove the taint reached every same-named function (sound over-report, never a missed flow).
- Closure/callback flows are invisible in both directions (e.g. arr.forEach(() => sink(y))) — the largest false-negative class.
- Property/field flows are not tracked (obj.x = taint; sink(obj.y) has no chain).
- Guard-style sanitizers (if (isValid(x))) and implicit/control-dependence flows are not modeled.
- CommonJS aliasing is partially modeled (require('<literal>') joins resolve; dynamic requires do not).
- Exception-path over-approximation can produce false-positive noise.

Findings are deliberately NOT part of impact()'s traversal or the web schema — explain is the dedicated taint consumer. SANITIZES (kill) edges are queryable via cypher.`,

MODES:
- \`controls\` — "under what condition does X run?". Returns, for the anchored function, each control-dependence edge: the controlling predicate block, the dependent block, and the branch sense ('T' = the predicate's true/taken arm, 'F' = its false/fall-through arm). An edge into an early return/throw block is flagged \`guard: true\` (subsumes the #559 guard heuristic); the branch sense of a guard depends on its predicate — \`if (!ok) return;\` rides the 'T' arm — so don't filter guards by a fixed label.
- \`flows\` — "where does variable Y flow?". Returns REACHING_DEF def→use edges for the anchored function; pass \`variable\` to filter to one binding.

WHEN TO USE: comprehension ("what guards this statement?"), data-flow tracing within a function, guard-clause discovery. Requires \`gitnexus analyze --pdg\`; without that layer the tool returns a clear "no PDG layer" note, not an error.

ANCHORING (required): \`target\` is a file path or a symbol/function name (resolved like context()). PDG queries are ALWAYS anchored — there is no whole-repo enumeration (an unanchored basic-block path scan is unbounded; LadybugDB has no rel-property index). A symbol target is line-range granular; an ambiguous name returns ranked candidates, unknown returns not-found.

CONTRACT CAVEATS:
- CDG labels are binary 'T'/'F' in M5/M6; per-case \`switch\` arm conditions are not yet distinguished (every case dispatch is 'T').
- Granularity is basic-block, reconstructed to the function via the BasicBlock id + line span (no Function→BasicBlock edge); deeply same-line-packed functions may anchor coarsely.
- Control/data dependence is intra-procedural (per function). Cross-function flow is taint's domain (\`explain\`).
- These edges are deliberately NOT part of impact()'s traversal — \`pdg_query\` is the dedicated consumer; raw edges are also queryable via \`cypher\`.`,

WHEN TO USE: BEFORE modifying any API route handler. Shows what consumers depend on, what response fields they access, what middleware protects the route, and what execution flows it triggers. Requires at least "route" or "file" parameter.

Risk levels: LOW (0-3 consumers), MEDIUM (4-9 or any mismatches), HIGH (10+ consumers or mismatches with 4+ consumers). Mismatches with confidence "low" indicate the consumer file fetches multiple routes — property attribution is approximate.

Response shape is keyed on how many routes match, not on the data: exactly one match returns a single route object; two or more return { routes: [...], total: N }. The same URL can expose multiple HTTP verbs (e.g. GET and POST /api/orders are distinct routes that share the URL), so a bare-URL lookup may return the wrapped form — every route object carries its own "method" so verbs are distinguishable. Pass "method" to narrow to one verb; the single-object shape is returned only when exactly one route remains after filtering — a substring route/file match spanning several URLs can still return the wrapped form. A URL/file that exists but has no route for the given verb returns an error. Each route's "method" is the literal "*" for method-agnostic routes (e.g. Django function views), which match any "method" selector, or null for method-less routes (filesystem, Laravel resource), which never match a selector.

Traverses CALLS edges plus HAS_METHOD (class → member) edges, so a trace can descend from a class into its methods. Each hop's edge type is reported in edges[], so call hops and containment hops remain distinguishable.

Returns: ordered hops with file:line, and an aligned edges[] of edge type + confidence. When no path exists, reports the furthest reachable node so you know where the chain breaks (and truncated: true if a traversal cap was hit first).

CROSS-REPO (experimental): pass repo as "@groupName" to trace across repositories in a group. When from/to live in different member repos, the trace stitches the two repo-local segments across a single ContractLink boundary (e.g. an HTTP consumer→provider link), clamped to one crossing. The result adds crossings[] (the bridged contract with matchType/confidence), tags each hop with its member repo, and a notes[] channel for degraded states. The boundary hop is reported with edge type CONTRACT_LINK. Pass pdg:true to also attach the intra-procedural data-flow (REACHING_DEF) for boundary-adjacent segments when those repos were indexed with --pdg; absent a PDG layer it degrades to call-level hops with a note.

DESTINATION TRACE (cross-repo): for an "@groupName" trace, OMIT to/to_uid/to_file to trace 'from' to wherever its outgoing HTTP call lands.
