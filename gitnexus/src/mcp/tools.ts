WHEN TO USE: First step when multiple repos are indexed, or to discover available repos.

    description: `Query the code knowledge graph for execution flows related to a concept.
Returns processes (call chains) ranked by relevance, each with its symbols and file locations.

WHEN TO USE: Understanding how code works together. Use this when you need execution flows and relationships, not just file matches. Complements grep/IDE search.
AFTER THIS: Use context() on a specific symbol for 360-degree view (callers, callees, categorized refs).

Returns results grouped by process (execution flow):
- processes: ranked execution flows with relevance priority
- process_symbols: all symbols in those flows with file locations and module (functional area)
- definitions: standalone types/interfaces not in any process

Hybrid ranking: BM25 keyword + semantic vector search, ranked by Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

GROUP MODE: set "repo" to "@<groupName>" to search all member repos in that group (merged via RRF), or "@<groupName>/<groupRepoPath>" to run against a single member (same path keys as in group.yaml). If you use "@<groupName>" only, the member repo defaults to the lexicographically first key in group.yaml "repos". Prefer resources for contracts/status (see migration from legacy group_* tools).

SERVICE: optional monorepo path prefix (POSIX-style, case-sensitive segments). When "repo" starts with "@", only processes whose symbols fall under that prefix are included. For a normal indexed repo name (no leading @), this field is currently ignored by the server.`,

WHEN TO USE: Complex structural queries that search/explore can't answer. READ gitnexus://repo/{name}/schema first for the full schema.
AFTER THIS: Use context() on result symbols for deeper context.

SCHEMA:
- Nodes: File, Folder, Function, Class, Interface, Method, CodeElement, Community, Process, Route, Tool
- Multi-language nodes (use backticks): \`Struct\`, \`Enum\`, \`Trait\`, \`Impl\`, etc.
- All edges via single CodeRelation table with 'type' property
- Edge types: CONTAINS, DEFINES, CALLS, IMPORTS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS, HAS_METHOD, HAS_PROPERTY, ACCESSES, METHOD_OVERRIDES, METHOD_IMPLEMENTS, MEMBER_OF, STEP_IN_PROCESS, HANDLES_ROUTE, FETCHES, HANDLES_TOOL, ENTRY_POINT_OF
- Edge properties: type (STRING), confidence (DOUBLE), reason (STRING), step (INT32)

EXAMPLES:
• Find callers of a function:
  MATCH (a)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'CALLS'}]->(b:Function {name: "validateUser"}) RETURN a.name, a.filePath

• Find community members:
  MATCH (f)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'MEMBER_OF'}]->(c:Community) WHERE c.heuristicLabel = "Auth" RETURN f.name

• Trace a process:
  MATCH (s)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'STEP_IN_PROCESS'}]->(p:Process) WHERE p.heuristicLabel = "UserLogin" RETURN s.name, r.step ORDER BY r.step

• Find all methods of a class:
  MATCH (c:Class {name: "UserService"})-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'HAS_METHOD'}]->(m:Method) RETURN m.name, m.parameterCount, m.returnType

• Find all properties of a class:
  MATCH (c:Class {name: "User"})-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'HAS_PROPERTY'}]->(p:Property) RETURN p.name, p.declaredType

• Find all writers of a field:
  MATCH (f:Function)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'ACCESSES', reason: 'write'}]->(p:Property) WHERE p.name = "address" RETURN f.name, f.filePath

• Find method overrides (MRO resolution):
  MATCH (winner:Method)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'METHOD_OVERRIDES'}]->(loser:Method) RETURN winner.name, winner.filePath, loser.filePath, r.reason

• Detect diamond inheritance:
  MATCH (d:Class)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(b1), (d)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(b2), (b1)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(a), (b2)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(a) WHERE b1 <> b2 RETURN d.name, b1.name, b2.name, a.name

OUTPUT: Returns { markdown, row_count } — results formatted as a Markdown table for easy reading.

TIPS:
- All relationships use single CodeRelation table — filter with {type: 'CALLS'} etc.
- Community = auto-detected functional area (Leiden algorithm). Properties: heuristicLabel, cohesion, symbolCount, keywords, description, enrichedBy
- Process = execution flow trace from entry point to terminal. Properties: heuristicLabel, processType, stepCount, communities, entryPointId, terminalId
- Use heuristicLabel (not label) for human-readable community/process names`,

WHEN TO USE: After query() to understand a specific symbol in depth. When you need to know all callers, callees, and what execution flows a symbol participates in.
AFTER THIS: Use impact() if planning changes, or READ gitnexus://repo/{name}/process/{processName} for full execution trace.

Handles disambiguation: if multiple symbols share the same name, returns ranked candidates (each with a relevance score) for you to pick from. Use uid for zero-ambiguity lookup, or narrow the search with file_path and/or kind hints.

NOTE: ACCESSES edges (field read/write tracking) are included in context results with reason 'read' or 'write'. CALLS edges resolve through field access chains and method-call chains (e.g., user.address.getCity().save() produces CALLS edges at each step).

GROUP MODE: set "repo" to "@<groupName>" to run context in each member repo (aggregated list), or "@<groupName>/<groupRepoPath>" for one member. If you use "@<groupName>" only, the member defaults to the lexicographically first key in group.yaml "repos".

GIT WORKTREE SUPPORT: GitNexus automatically detects when the MCP server was launched from inside a linked git worktree and runs git diff against that worktree — no extra parameters needed in the common case. Pass "worktree" explicitly only when the server was started from a different directory than the worktree you are editing (e.g., the server runs from the canonical root but your changes are in a linked worktree at a different path).

    description: `Analyze the blast radius of changing a code symbol.
Returns affected symbols grouped by depth, plus risk assessment, affected execution flows, and affected modules.

WHEN TO USE: Before making code changes — especially refactoring, renaming, or modifying shared code. Shows what would break.
AFTER THIS: Review d=1 items (WILL BREAK). Use context() on high-risk symbols.

Output includes:
- risk: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL
- summary: direct callers, processes affected, modules affected
- affected_processes: which execution flows break and at which step
- affected_modules: which functional areas are hit (direct vs indirect)
- byDepth: affected symbols grouped by traversal depth (paginated by limit/offset; omitted when summaryOnly:true — use byDepthCounts for totals per depth, pagination object when truncated). Each item includes a processes:[{id,label,processType,step}] field listing the execution flows that symbol participates in. Empty when the symbol has no process membership. Can ALSO be empty when partial:true is set — either the process-aggregation pass hit its cap before detecting affected processes, or per-symbol enrichment was capped on a very large page. When partial:true, do NOT treat processes:[] as proof of no participation; cross-check the top-level affected_processes list.

Depth groups:
- d=1: WILL BREAK (direct callers/importers)
- d=2: LIKELY AFFECTED (indirect)
- d=3: MAY NEED TESTING (transitive)

TIP: For hub symbols (base error classes, shared utilities) with many direct callers, use summaryOnly: true first to see counts and risk, then drill into specific depths with limit/offset. maxDepth alone does not bound output size when most dependents are at depth 1. limit and offset apply independently to each depth level, not to the total result set — use byDepthCounts to see totals per depth.

TIP: Default traversal uses CALLS/IMPORTS/EXTENDS/IMPLEMENTS. For class members, include HAS_METHOD and HAS_PROPERTY in relationTypes. For field access analysis, include ACCESSES in relationTypes.

Handles disambiguation: when multiple symbols share the target name, returns ranked candidates (each with a relevance score) instead of silently picking one. Use target_uid for zero-ambiguity lookup, or narrow with file_path and/or kind hints.

EdgeType: CALLS, IMPORTS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS, HAS_METHOD, HAS_PROPERTY, METHOD_OVERRIDES, METHOD_IMPLEMENTS, ACCESSES

Phase-1 walk runs in that member; cross-boundary fan-out uses the group bridge.

WHEN TO USE: Detecting mismatches between what an API route returns and what consumers expect. Finding shape drift. For pre-change analysis, prefer \`api_impact\` which combines this data with mismatch detection and risk assessment.
REQUIRES: Route nodes with responseKeys (extracted from .json({...}) calls during indexing).

Returns routes that have both detected response keys AND consumers. Shows top-level keys each endpoint returns (e.g., data, pagination, error) and what keys each consumer accesses. Reports MISMATCH status when a consumer accesses keys not present in the route's response shape.`,

WHEN TO USE: BEFORE modifying any API route handler. Shows what consumers depend on, what response fields they access, what middleware protects the route, and what execution flows it triggers. Requires at least "route" or "file" parameter.

Risk levels: LOW (0-3 consumers), MEDIUM (4-9 or any mismatches), HIGH (10+ consumers or mismatches with 4+ consumers). Mismatches with confidence "low" indicate the consumer file fetches multiple routes — property attribution is approximate.

Returns: single route object when one match, or { routes: [...], total: N } for multiple matches. Combines route_map, shape_check, and impact data.`,
