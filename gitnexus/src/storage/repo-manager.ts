/**
 * Normalise a repo path for registry comparison across platforms
 * (#664 review feedback from @evander-wang).
 *
 * Why this exists: `path.resolve` alone is NOT enough for
 * cross-platform registry stability.
 *   - **macOS**: tmpdirs and `/var` are symlinks to `/private/var`.
 *     A child process that stored `/private/var/folders/.../repo` in
 *     the registry cannot later be matched by an outer caller that
 *     supplies the symlink form `/var/folders/.../repo`. `path.resolve`
 *     does not follow symlinks; `realpathSync.native` does.
 *   - **Windows**: GitHub runners surface tmpdirs in 8.3 short-name
 *     form (`RUNNERA~1\...`), but `process.cwd()` often returns the
 *     long form (`runneradmin\...`). `realpathSync.native` normalises
 *     both sides to the long-name canonical path.
 *
 * Fallback behaviour: if the path does not exist on disk (e.g. a user
 * passed `gitnexus remove some-alias` and the alias misses every
 * registry entry, or the caller is resolving a path that was deleted
 * after registration), we return `path.resolve(p)` rather than
 * throwing. This preserves the idempotent-on-missing semantics of
 * `resolveRegistryEntry` / `remove`.
 *
 * Backwards compatibility: this function is applied to BOTH the
 * caller-supplied input AND each stored `entry.path` at compare time
 * inside `resolveRegistryEntry`, so registries written by older
 * versions (where `registerRepo` only ran `path.resolve`) still match
 * correctly. Newly-written entries are canonicalised at write time too
 * so the registry stabilises over analyze/re-analyze cycles.

// ─── Sibling-clone detection ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A "sibling clone" is a different on-disk path that points at the same
// logical repository (same `origin` remote URL) as a registered index.
// This shows up in three operationally important shapes (see issue):
//
//   1. The same repo is checked out under multiple paths (worktrees,
//      multi-agent workspaces). Only one is indexed; the others silently
//      diverge from the graph.
//   2. The indexed clone is itself behind its own HEAD (the existing
//      `checkStaleness` already handles this case).
//   3. A query is issued from a `cwd` that lives inside a sibling clone
//      whose HEAD has drifted from the indexed `lastCommit`.
//
// Detection is intentionally remote-URL-based and does NOT walk the
// filesystem hunting for unregistered clones — only registered entries
// are considered. The `cwd`-driven branch ({@link checkSiblingDrift})
// also accepts an unregistered cwd, because the live caller's working
// directory is the one place we can cheaply learn about an
// unregistered clone.

/**
 * Find other registered entries whose `remoteUrl` matches the given
 * one, excluding `selfPath` (case-insensitive on Windows). Entries
 * without a `remoteUrl` are ignored — we cannot prove sibling-ness
 * without a fingerprint.
