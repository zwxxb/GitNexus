 * Worker IPC uses Node's native `worker.postMessage(value, transferList)`

 * `postMessage` preserves Map / Set / Date / RegExp / BigInt /
 * TypedArray / undefined values / circular refs out of the box —
 * no explicit serializer needed. File contents move zero-copy via
 * `transferList` for their ArrayBuffers; everything else is cloned
 * tree-walk style by the same algorithm a wrapper serializer would
 * call anyway. The previous `protocol.ts` framing layer was a redundant
 * V8.serialize → Buffer → postMessage(struct-clone-Buffer) double-walk;
 * removing it cut one full structured-clone pass per message.
 *
 * Sub-batch dispatch payload shape:
 *   `{ type: 'sub-batch', files: Array<{ path: string; content: Uint8Array }> }`
 *
 * The file `content` is a `Uint8Array` (not a string) so its
 * underlying `ArrayBuffer` can be transferred zero-copy via
 * `transferList`. The worker calls `new TextDecoder('utf-8').decode`
 * lazily at the tree-sitter call site.
 *
 * `Uint8Array` instances are allocated via `TextEncoder.encode`, which
 * produces a dedicated `ArrayBuffer` per call. Node's `Buffer.from(str,
 * 'utf8')` and `Buffer.alloc` may carve from the shared `Buffer.poolSize`
 * slab, and transferring one pool-backed `ArrayBuffer` detaches every
 * other Buffer sharing the slab — silent data corruption. TextEncoder
 * bypasses the pool, so transferring its outputs is safe.

 * - Layer 2 (circuit breaker): `consecutiveFailureThreshold` consecutive

 *   respawn budget — trip the breaker. Every subsequent dispatch rejects
 *   with `WorkerPoolDispatchError` and the caller must build a new pool.
 * - Layer 3 (quarantine): a path identified as the in-flight file at the
 *   time of a worker death is added to `quarantined` and filtered out of
 *   future dispatches. Snapshot via {@link WorkerPool.getQuarantinedPaths}.
 * - Layer 4 (authoritative in-flight): the worker emits a `starting-file`
 *   message before each parse attempt; the pool prefers this for crash
 *   attribution and falls back to {@link inFlightExcludePath} only when no
 *   signal has been observed yet.
 * - Layer 5 (cumulative timeout budget): each job tracks the total wall
 *   time spent across all attempts/splits/retries. When the budget is
 *   exhausted, the pool surfaces the in-flight path via `WorkerPoolDispatchError`
 *   instead of letting timeouts compound indefinitely.
 *
 * Upstream of these layers, the parse worker self-sanitizes a result that the
 * structured-clone algorithm can't serialize (#2112) — stripping or dropping
 * the offending value and reporting the affected paths on the result — so a
 * single non-cloneable value can't masquerade as a worker death and exhaust a

  //    respawned after jittered backoff and retried, up to STARTUP_RESTART_BUDGET
  //    — so a blip heals itself with no operator intervention.
  //  - DETERMINISTIC crash-loop (every worker dies with the SAME signature
  //    before any reaches ready — the #1741 missing-binding case): detected via
  //    `crashSignature` and short-circuited immediately, so the pool gives up in
  //    ~1s rather than burning every slot's budget.
  //
  // When the loop exhausts, the slot is dropped from `activeSlots`. If EVERY
  // slot is dropped, the first dispatch throws WorkerPoolInitializationError
  // carrying the captured crash cause + classification — never a silent hang.
  // Correctness of the deterministic short-circuit rests on the STRUCTURAL
  // signal (zero workers ever ready + budget exhausted), not on signature
  // matching alone: a missed match only costs a few seconds of extra retrying.
  // Deterministic crash-loop detection (#1741). A crash counts toward
  // "deterministic" ONLY after its signature reproduces across a respawn on the
  // same slot — so every slot is guaranteed at least one self-heal attempt and
  // a simultaneous attempt-0 crash storm (e.g. transient `spawn EAGAIN` under
  // fork pressure) cannot be misclassified as deterministic. We short-circuit
