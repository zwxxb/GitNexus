/**
 * Streaming PDG graph-emit sink (issue #2202).
 *
 * The PDG emit loop (`scope-resolution/pipeline/run.ts`, the `--pdg` block)
 * materializes BasicBlock nodes + intra-file PDG edges (CFG / REACHING_DEF /
 * CDG / POST_DOMINATE / TAINTED / SANITIZES) into the in-memory
 * `KnowledgeGraph`. At full-kernel scale that layer dominates peak RSS
 * (~7 GB at 511K BasicBlocks; ~100 GB extrapolated to the full kernel → OOM).
 *
 * `PdgEmitSink` is a write-routing façade over the real graph: the emit
 * functions are write-only and compute every edge endpoint by deterministic id
 * (audited — no read-back), so the sink can route BasicBlock node rows and PDG
 * edge rows straight to bounded CSV-on-disk writers and **never store them**.
 * The graph's resident size stops growing with the PDG layer → peak RSS becomes
 * O(chunk buffer), not O(graph). Everything else (structural nodes/edges, the
 * whole-program M4 TAINT_PATH edges) is delegated to the real graph unchanged.
 *
 * Why synchronous writers? The whole PDG emit (`runScopeResolution` and its
 * per-file loop) is synchronous — there is no `await` point to drain an async
 * stream, so a `BufferedCSVWriter` (Node `WriteStream`) would accumulate
 * unwritten chunks in process memory across millions of rows, defeating the RSS
 * bound. `fs.writeSync` goes straight to the OS; resident memory is bounded to
 * one `chunkRows` buffer. This mirrors the sync-shard pattern in
 * `storage/parsedfile-store.ts`.
 *
 * Byte-identity (issue acceptance): the sink reuses the SAME shared row
 * builders (`buildBasicBlockRow`, `buildRelRow`) and label derivation
 * (`getNodeLabel`) as `streamAllCSVsToDisk`, so the streamed CSV line SET is
 * identical to the whole-graph emit's, and the bulk COPY loads the same rows →
 * the persisted graph is SET-identical and DB-identical. The guarantee is
 * set-level, not byte-level on the CSV file: the sink streams rows in emit
 * order and does NOT re-sort them under `GITNEXUS_SORT_GRAPH_OUTPUT`, so a
 * streamed CSV file is not necessarily byte-for-byte equal to the sorted
 * whole-graph CSV — but the row set, and therefore the DB outcome, is. (The
 * streamed CSVs are deleted right after the COPY, so their on-disk byte order
 * is never observed.) Cross-pass dedup is done upstream, per FILE, in the emit
 * loop (`run.ts` skips a file whose PDG already streamed) rather than in the
 * sink, because a file can be PDG-emitted in more than one language pass (a
 * `.ts` module imported by a `.vue` SFC is emitted in both the TypeScript and
 * Vue context passes over the same worker-built CFG) and a sink-level per-id
 * dedup set would retain every id → O(total ids) memory, defeating the
 * O(chunk) RSS bound (#2202 review #1). The differential fingerprint test
 * (issue #2202 U6) and the Vue+TS cross-pass integration test guard the set.
