# Changelog

All notable changes to GitNexus will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.8] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **PDG-backed impact analysis (opt-in)** — `impact` gains a `mode: 'pdg'` that runs statement-level and inter-procedural program slicing for far more precise blast radius, with resolved-callee-id soundness and validation by a mutation oracle; the default call-graph mode is unchanged (#2227)
- **Program Dependence Graph substrate across the language matrix** — a control-flow-graph layer landed for TS/JS (#2099) and was extended to PDG/CFG visitors for every supported language (#2197); on top of it an intra-procedural `REACHING_DEF` data-dependence layer (#2160), value-position branches (`if`/`when`/`switch`/`match`/`try` used as expressions) modeled as control dependence (#2211), and full control dependence via post-dominators + a Ferrante-style CDG (#2188). All layers are opt-in behind `--pdg`; a default `analyze` run stays byte-identical (#2082, #2085, #2205, #2207, #2195)
- **Taint analysis** — intra-procedural taint tracking over the PDG (#2164) plus inter-procedural taint via function summaries propagated over resolved `CALLS` edges (#2179) (#2083, #2084)
- **Multi-branch indexing and branch-scoped querying** — analyze and query a repository per branch, with each branch stored under its own subdirectory and the primary branch layout left unchanged (#2137, #2106)
- **Private GitHub repos via PAT + Azure DevOps Server support** — `gitnexus analyze` can clone private GitHub repositories with a personal access token and supports Azure DevOps Server remotes (#2223, #2076, #2210)
- **MCP `trace` tool** — returns the shortest call path between two symbols (#2173)
- **MCP HTTP server** — `gitnexus mcp --http` exposes the server over Streamable HTTP with legacy SSE transport support (#2141)
- **HTTP route extraction** — Java Spring route annotations are now extracted into `Route` nodes (#2078), and the HTTP method is persisted on each `Route` node (#2234, #2138)
- **`gitnexus analyze` circular import cycle check** (#2166)
- **`gitnexus analyze` embeddings flags** — `--embeddings-baseurl`, `--embeddings-model`, `--embeddings-auth-token`, and `--embeddings-dims` to point analyze at a custom embeddings provider (#2140)
- **`gitnexus setup` coding-agent integration selection** — choose which coding-agent integrations to install during setup (#2168)
- **C++ CUDA source extensions parsed** — `.cu`/`.cuh` files are now ingested (#2213)

### Fixed

- **`impact()` / `route_map` under-reporting blast radius** — name-resolution gaps that caused callers and routes to be dropped are fixed, with ambiguous symbols reported per-candidate (#2136, #2129, #1858, #1852)
- **Single-ancestor method override detection in the MRO processor** (#2199)
- **MCP `query` / `cypher` parameter names** — renamed so Claude Code can invoke them, while still accepting the legacy parameter (#2186)
- **C++ overload resolution** — homogeneous braced-init overloads are now ranked (#2214), deleted overload winners are suppressed (#2094), and the C++ hook layer handles pack-base comments and missing hook overrides (#2247)
- **Large-repo `analyze` crash** — the pipeline now survives non-cloneable worker results instead of aborting (#2135, #2112)
- **Embeddings** — `onnxruntime-common` resolves under pnpm-strict / `pnpm dlx` installs (#2139, #307), and the `VECTOR` index is created via `conn.query` rather than the prepared-statement path that silently skipped it (#2114)
- **Vendored tree-sitter grammars** — loaded from `vendor/` by absolute path so analyze finds them regardless of CWD (#2144, #2111)
- **Registry wipe on transient I/O errors prevented** — a failed read no longer clears the repository registry (#2124)
- **Server roots resolve from `GITNEXUS_HOME`** — clone, upload, and mapping roots honor the configured home directory (#2229)
- **Wiki generation keeps the graph DB pinned** so it is not evicted mid-generation (#2232)
- **Group sync pins repositories** so large groups resolve their cross-repo links (#2191)
- **Web viewer** — a chat-only mode for large projects prevents the WebUI from hanging (#2185, #2178), and the broken Browse-for-folder control was replaced with an upload directory picker (#1850)
- **Hooks** — the augment CLI child is wrapped in the orphan guard (#2169), db-lock probe subprocesses are bounded and gated behind a hook slot (#2165), and the MCP-owned-DB augment-skip diagnostic is silenced for strict hook runners (#2134, #2163, #1913)
- **Docker image ships runtime-needed published assets** — `hooks/` and `skills/` are copied into the image so `gitnexus analyze` no longer crashes with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (#2132, #2130)
- **`gitnexus analyze` preserves trailing spaces in git roots** (#2192)
- **Write-route origin guard scoped to the server's own bound host** (#2172)
- **Impact PDG Mutation Report workflow** — fixed three latent oracle bugs (dist-CLI invocation under Node ≥ 22.18 type-stripping, undeclared `@babel/*` deps, and a recall-gated check filter) so the mutation oracle CI runs green (#2258)

### Changed

- **tree-sitter readiness/summary CI hardened** — readiness and grammar-update workflows aligned on a shared manifest (#2187, #858), readiness summary counts kept current (#2196), and the summary now fails on parse drift (#2246)
- **Devcontainer simplified** — Dockerfile and `devcontainer.json` no longer pin version args for the AI CLIs (#2174)

### Performance

- **Graph-DB emit/persistence** — cut overall emit/persistence wall time (#2215) and overlap node `COPY` with relationship emit (#2226) (#2203)
- **PDG/CFG emit** — streaming/chunked PDG graph emit for full-kernel-scale repos (#2216, #2202) and an SSA-sparse reaching-defs solver replacing the dense-set worklist (#2212, #2201)
- **Hook db-lock scan** — cmdline-first on Linux, dropping the `lsof` fallback (#2183, #2180)

### Chore / Dependencies

## [1.6.7] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Toolchain-free tree-sitter install** — the `c`, `dart`, `proto`, `kotlin`, and `swift` grammars now ship vendored native prebuilds (six platform/arch each — linux/darwin/win32 × x64/arm64, every `.node` load-and-parse verified with committed `SHA256SUMS` and SLSA build provenance), so a fresh install no longer requires a C/C++ toolchain; `kotlin` moved off its `optionalDependency` into the vendored path, `dart`/`proto` keep a source-build fallback when no prebuild matches, and a registry-parameterized CI workflow builds, load-validates, and vendors the binaries (#2113, #2125, #2110)
- **`gitnexus uninstall`** — reverses `gitnexus setup` target-by-target, surgically removing GitNexus MCP server entries (Cursor, Claude Code, Antigravity, OpenCode, Codex), installed skill directories, and Claude Code / Antigravity hook entries with their bundled scripts; idempotent, JSONC-preserving, dry-run by default with `--force` to apply (#2062, #2060)
- **MCP `list_repos` pagination** — bounded `limit`/`offset` paging so clients can reliably enumerate every indexed repository instead of having the unpaginated array truncated by LLM token limits; the result is now a `{ repositories, pagination }` object (page until `pagination.hasMore` is false), with deterministic `(lower-cased name, path)` ordering (#2120, #2119)
- **C++ inheritance-lattice member lookup** — receiver members now resolve through the inheritance lattice with dominance hiding, ambiguous-base suppression, virtual-diamond deduplication, and overload ranking, and class-scope `using Base::member` declarations are no longer mistaken for namespace imports (#2077, #1891)
- **Taint/PDG substrate (M0)** — foundational graph schema and pipeline seams for reliable taint analysis on a PDG-expandable substrate: the `BasicBlock` node label and `CFG` / `REACHING_DEF` / `TAINTED` / `SANITIZES` / `TAINT_PATH` relationship types (round-tripped through the bulk-COPY path), a phase-registry seam (`registerPhase` / `enabledWhen`) generalising the graph-phase opt-in guard, and a per-language source/sink/sanitizer config registry. All additive and inert — no phase emits the new nodes/edges yet and a default `analyze` run is byte-identical to before (#2092, #2080)

### Fixed

- **Optional grammars lazy-loaded so `analyze` never crashes when one is missing** — the swift/dart/kotlin `query.ts` modules no longer statically import their tree-sitter binding at module load, so a missing optional grammar can no longer abort `gitnexus analyze` (or the MCP server, `doctor`, and `.githooks` auto-reindex) with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` regardless of the repo's actual languages; grammars now resolve lazily at first use inside the worker, `GITNEXUS_SKIP_OPTIONAL_GRAMMARS` is honored at runtime, the scope-resolution phase excludes unavailable-language files, and skip diagnostics/precheck globs were corrected (#2101, #2091, #2093)
- **`tree-sitter-kotlin` optional-grammar install** — install now fails soft when no C/C++ toolchain is present, emitting one clear warning and always exiting 0 (mirroring the Swift/Dart/Proto probes) instead of breaking `gitnexus` install; optional-grammar/toolchain docs corrected to include Kotlin (#2110, #2107)
- **CLI image FTS keyword search** — the full-text-search extension is now baked into the CLI Docker image so a containerized `serve` does offline keyword search instead of silently degrading to vector-only (#2108)

### Changed

- **Tree-sitter prebuild CI matrix greened and made re-run-safe** — dropped the broken `-t 22` flag from the `prebuildify` invocation that crashed every matrix job (`v.indexOf is not a function`; N-API prebuilds are Node-version-agnostic, so no target is needed) (#2121), cleared npm-bundled `prebuilds/` before prebuildify so the host tuple is detected (not a stray `win32-x64`) and source-built the `tree-sitter` runtime peer on `linux-arm64` where upstream ships no prebuild (#2122), and switched the vendor-prebuilds push to `git push --force` so re-running a workflow no longer fails with a stale-lease rejection (#2123)

### Performance

- **MCP `query` enrichment batched** — the `query` tool now batches its per-symbol enrichment lookups (3N sequential pool round-trips collapsed to 2–3 `WHERE n.id IN $nodeIds` queries), cutting N+1 round-trips with byte-identical output (#2108)

### Chore / Dependencies

- **`@ladybugdb/core` bumped 0.17.0 → 0.17.1 in /gitnexus** (#2098)
- **Claude plugin manifests synced to the release version** — bumped `plugin.json` and the `gitnexus` `marketplace.json` entry to match the published npm version (stale `1.3.x` manifests had blocked marketplace updates), added a Vitest guard asserting all three manifests advertise one version, and documented the sync step in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (#2090)

## [1.6.6] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Wiki** — local Claude/Codex providers (#1769), an opencode local provider (#2039), and `gitnexus wiki --lang <lang>` for multilanguage wiki generation (#1613)
- **`detect-changes` git-worktree support** (#1654)

- **Windows reliability** — pin tree-sitter-c/cpp to fix segfault, prefer `.cmd`/`.bat` from `where` output, robust LadybugDB lock acquisition for CI integration tests, surface silent finalize-skips so analyze cannot exit 0 without persisting. Closes #1242, #1427, #1447, #1468, #1400; partial #1218 (#1243, #1299, #1430, #1237, #1226, #1235)

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Cross-repo impact analysis** — `@repo` MCP routing plus group resources let impact queries span multiple indexed repositories in a group (#794, #984)
- **Python scope-based call resolution** — registry-primary flip, performance, and generalization work from RFC #909 Ring 3 (#980)
- **C# scope-resolution migration** — C# now runs on the registry-primary path alongside Python (#934, #1019)
- **RFC #909 Ring 1 & Ring 2 scope-resolution infrastructure** — the shared foundation for language-agnostic scope resolution:
  - Scope-resolution types and constants, `LanguageProvider` hook extension (#910, #911, #949, #950)
  - `ScopeTree` + `PositionIndex` + `makeScopeId` (#912, #961)
  - `DefIndex` / `ModuleScopeIndex` / `QualifiedNameIndex` (#913, #958)
  - `MethodDispatchIndex` materialized view over `HeritageMap` (#914, #960)
  - `resolveTypeRef` strict single-return type resolver (#916, #959)
  - SCC-aware finalize with bounded fixpoint (#915, #962)
  - `ClassRegistry` / `MethodRegistry` / `FieldRegistry` + 7-step lookup (#917, #963)
  - Shadow-mode diff + aggregate, parity harness + static dashboard (#918, #923, #951, #972)

- **Auto-infer registry name** from `git remote.origin.url` when `--name` is omitted (#981)
- **Sibling-clone drift detection** — indexed repos are fingerprinted by remote URL so duplicate registrations are caught before graph divergence (#982)
- **Configurable large-file skip threshold** — the walker's 512 KB default is now overridable via `GITNEXUS_MAX_FILE_SIZE` (KB) or `gitnexus analyze --max-file-size <kb>`. Values are clamped to the 32 MB tree-sitter ceiling, invalid inputs fall back to the default with a one-time warning, and the CLI banner reports the effective post-clamp threshold when an override is active (#991, #1044, #1045)
- **`GITNEXUS_INDEX_TEST_DIRS` opt-in** for `__tests__` / `__mocks__` traversal (#771, #1046)

- **Docker images for UI + CLI/server** shipped via `docker-compose` with cosign signing (#967), RC image builds (#978), and GHCR → Docker Hub mirroring (#1029)

### Fixed

- **Go CALLS edges for receiver methods** — worker source IDs now align with the main pipeline, restoring receiver-method call edges (#1043)
- **Node 22 DEP0151 warning** from `tree-sitter-c-sharp` import silenced (#1013, #1049)
- **FTS index bootstrap** tries a local `LOAD` before `INSTALL` so offline/air-gapped runs no longer fail on network errors (#726)
- **FTS ensure failures** are no longer cached and are invalidated on pool teardown (#1006)
- **`groupImpact` local-impact errors** now bubble to the caller instead of being swallowed (#1004, #1007)
- **Friendly error** when a group name is not found, with regression test for #903 (#989)
- **`bm25` results** return FTS-matched symbols instead of an arbitrary `LIMIT 3` slice (#806)
- **Embedding AST traversal** switched from recursion to iterative DFS, fixing stack overflow on deeply nested files (#990)
- **React component path detection** runs before lowercasing, so mixed-case `.jsx`/`.tsx` files are recognised (#260)
- **`detect-changes` ENOBUFS** by setting `maxBuffer` on `git` / `rg` `execFileSync` invocations (#957)
- **`detect-changes` in direct CLI** — command was wired to MCP only; now exposed on the CLI as well (#892)
- **CLI gitnexus markers** — `<!-- gitnexus:* -->` is only matched at section position, no longer inside code/prose (#1041, #1042)
- **`opencode.json` setup** preserves existing comments and config during install (#998)
- **Sequential parser logging** — skipped languages are now logged instead of silently dropped (#1021)
- **`cli-e2e` fixture isolation** from the shared mini-repo, plus stabilised `rel-csv-split` stream teardown on Windows via `expect.poll` (#954, #1052)
- **Docker** — RC build guarded against empty `vtag`, `inputs.tag` used to detect `workflow_call` context, web builder stage now copies `gitnexus/package.json`, base image switched from alpine to debian (#983, #996, #997, #1014)
- **CI** — reusable `docker.yml` now inherits secrets from `release-candidate.yml` (#1054)

### Changed

- **`setup` config I/O unified** on `mergeJsoncFile` across all writers (#1031)
- **Docker CI** gains a retry wrapper for `build-push` with visibility and hardened shell

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Docker support** — containerized ingestion and MCP serving for reproducible runs on CI and container platforms (#848)
- **Language-agnostic heritage extractor** — config+factory pattern for class-heritage extraction (EXTENDS / IMPLEMENTS), completing the extractor refactor alongside method/field/call/variable (#890)
- **Language-agnostic call extractor** — config+factory pattern that collapses ~225 lines of inline parse-worker logic into declarative per-language configs (#877)
- **Language-agnostic variable extractor** — structured metadata for `Const` / `Static` / `Variable` nodes via config+factory pattern (#878)
- **AST-aware embedding chunking** — offset-based splitting preserves symbol boundaries, improving semantic search precision on large files (#889)
- **HTTP consumer detection for jQuery and axios object-form** — `$.ajax` / `$.get` / `$.post` and `axios({ url, method })` now recognized as HTTP call sites (#887)

### Fixed

- **Python external dotted imports** — avoid spurious same-file matches when an import path like `foo.bar.baz` refers to a third-party module (#899)
- **Worker warnings no longer terminate ingestion** — non-fatal parser warnings keep the pipeline running instead of aborting the run (#900, #261)
- **Global-install upgrade `ENOTEMPTY`** — devendored `tree-sitter-proto` install lifecycle + preinstall cleanup so `npm i -g gitnexus@latest` succeeds on top of an older install (#843, #846)
- **`env.cacheDir`** now defaults to a user-writable location, unblocking ingestion on systems where the install directory is read-only (#845)
- **Content-hash staleness detection for embeddings** — zero-node rebuilds no longer skip vector-index creation, fixing semantic search after selective re-analysis (#831)
- **`tree-sitter-c-sharp` version pin** — locked to 0.23.1 to avoid a breaking change in a transitive prerelease (#834)
- **`release-drafter` v7 CI** — replaced the removed `disable-releaser` flag with `dry-run` so release-note drafts still work
- **`npm arborist` crash from `tree-sitter-dart`** — switched the dependency URL format so `npm install` no longer crashes on clean installs
- **Service-group `ManifestExtractor`** — `config.links` now wires the manifest extractor properly, restoring cross-link discovery that had silently dropped to zero

### Changed

- **SemanticModel wired as a first-class resolution input (SM-20)** — `call-processor`, `resolution-context`, `type-env`, and `heritage-map` now consult `table.model.*` directly; 37 internal call sites migrated off the SymbolTable wrapper (#885)
- **Per-strategy `ImportSemantics` hooks** — `named` / `wildcard-transitive` / `wildcard-leaf` / `namespace` strategies split into composable hooks, replacing the monolithic conditional (Strategies 1–4 of #886)
- **Class extraction configs moved to `configs/` subdirectory** — per-language class configs now co-locate with the other extractor configs, completing the extractor layer's directory convention (#879)
- **CLI AI-context trimmed** — duplicated CLAUDE.md block removed from the shipped context, reducing token usage in LLM-consuming workflows (#904)
- **LLM context files optimized** — AI-consumed documentation tuned for accuracy and token efficiency (#857)
- **Workflow concurrency standardized** — all CI workflows adopt the consistent concurrency key pattern documented in CONTRIBUTING.md; release-note labeling automated (#837)

## [1.5.3] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **TypeScript/JavaScript MethodExtractor** config (#588)

### Fixed
- **Wiki Azure OpenAI** compat and HTML viewer script injection (#618)

## [1.5.2] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **`gitnexus-shared` module not found** — `gitnexus-shared` was a `file:` workspace dependency never published to npm, causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when installing `gitnexus` globally. The build now bundles shared code into `dist/_shared/` and rewrites imports to relative paths (#613)
- **v1.5.1 publish regression** — npm's `prepare` lifecycle ran `tsc` after `prepack`, overwriting the rewritten imports before packing; both scripts now run the full build so the final tarball is always correct

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-01 [YANKED]

### Fixed
- Incomplete fix for `gitnexus-shared` bundling — `prepare` script overwrote rewritten imports during publish

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Repo landing screen** — when the backend detects indexed repositories, the web UI now shows a landing page with selectable repo cards (name, stats, indexed date) instead of auto-loading the first repo; users can also analyze new repos directly from the landing screen (#607)

  - Onboarding flow: auto-detect server → connect → repo landing or analyze
  - Header repo dropdown: switch, re-analyze, or delete repos
- **Azure OpenAI support for wiki command** — fixed broken Azure auth (`api-key` header), `api-version` URL parameter, reasoning model handling (`max_completion_tokens`, no `temperature`), content filter error messages; added interactive setup wizard, `--api-version` and `--reasoning-model` CLI flags (#562)
- **Java method references & interface dispatch** — `obj::method` treated as call sites, overload selection via typed variable args (not just literals), interface dispatch emits additional CALLS edges to implementing classes (#540)
- **MethodExtractor abstraction** — structured method metadata extraction (isAbstract, isFinal, annotations, visibility, parameter types) with config-driven factory pattern (#576)
  - Java and Kotlin configs with overload-safe `methodInfoCache` keyed by `name:line`
  - C# config with `sealed`, `params`/`out`/`ref`/optional parameters, `[Attribute]` syntax, `internal` visibility (#582)
- **`--skip-agents-md` CLI flag** — opt out of overwriting GitNexus-managed sections in AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md during `gitnexus analyze` (#517)
- **Prettier** — monorepo-wide code formatter with lint-staged + Husky pre-commit hook, `.prettierrc` config, Tailwind CSS v4 plugin, `endOfLine: "lf"` + `.gitattributes` for Windows consistency (#563)
- **ESLint v9** — flat config with `unused-imports` auto-removal, `@typescript-eslint` rules, React hooks rules, CI `lint` job (#564)

### Fixed
- **OpenCode MCP configuration** — corrected README MCP setup for OpenCode which requires `command` as an array containing both executable and arguments (#363)
- **litellm security** — excluded vulnerable versions 1.82.7 and 1.82.8 in eval harness `pyproject.toml` (#580)

### Changed
- **Reduced explicit `any` types** — 128 `no-explicit-any` warnings eliminated (689 → 561, 19% reduction) across `NodeProperties` index signature, ~80 `SyntaxNode` substitutions, typed worker protocol, and graphology community detection (#566)

### Docs
- Added `gitnexus-shared` build step to web UI quick start instructions (#585)
- Added enterprise offering section to README (#579)

## [1.4.10] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

  - Align all parser versions to their highest ^0.21.x-compatible releases
  - Remove tree-sitter override (only applies to root packages, ignored by npx)
  - Pin tree-sitter-dart to correct ABI-14-compatible commit
  - Exact pins for tree-sitter-c (0.23.2), tree-sitter-python (0.23.4), tree-sitter-rust (0.23.1) where next patch requires ^0.22.x
