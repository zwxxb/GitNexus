# /commandhistory). When they first mount, they take the user ID baked into the
# image, before any realignment. Then `updateRemoteUserUID: true` shifts the
# `node` user to a new ID. Now the volumes are owned by the old, stale ID, and
# writes into them fail. (~/.local is a directory in the image, not a volume.
# We chown it too, just to be safe.) install-deps.sh fixes the workspace side.
# This script fixes the AI CLI side, so each lifecycle hook handles its own part.
#
# There are two separate guards here, and they do different things. `-xdev`
# keeps find from descending into other filesystems. The shareable dirs (skills,
# agents, plugins, memory, commands, prompts, rules) are no longer host bind
# mounts — they now live INSIDE the config volume (seeded in step 3/4), so
# `-xdev` correctly walks and chowns them as the container-private volume files
# they are. What `-xdev` still stops at are the SESSION volumes (mount group 6),
# which remain separate filesystems mounted at sub-paths (see below). `-h` tells
# chown to act on a symlink ITSELF instead of following it, so it never lands on
# a target across a filesystem boundary and never aborts on a broken symlink
# under `set -e` (a legacy Option-B symlink could still exist on a carried-over
# volume). For regular files and directories `-h` does nothing extra.
#
# The session volumes (mount group 6: .claude/projects, .codex/sessions,
# .cursor/chats, .cursor/projects) are their OWN filesystems mounted at
# sub-paths, so `-xdev` rooted at the config-volume parent deliberately skips
# them. That is why each one is listed as its own root below: rooted there,
# `-xdev` walks just that volume and chowns its top level, so the CLI's first
# write doesn't hit EACCES on a stale image UID. These are container-private
# volumes, not the host's own files — the read-only /host/.<cli> stages we copy
# from are mounted elsewhere and are never chowned.

# the named volume in step 3/4 below, so a compromised in-container dependency
# can't write through to the host's on-disk CLI setup. This step handles only the
# credentials, identity, and single config files. Those stay per-container in the

#   - .credentials.json (Claude OAuth tokens)
#   - .claude/.claude.json (Claude identity: userID, oauthAccount, and
#     migration tracking — a different file from $HOME/.claude.json)
#   - settings.json (Claude), config.toml (Codex), mcp.json (Cursor). These are
#     single config files, and single files can't be bind-mounted on Windows
#     (the EXDEV error explained below).

# How the sync behaves: it ALWAYS overwrites from the host when the container is

# container does NOT log out the host. Per-container login is the goal, and
# bind-mounting these files would instead make a logout shared between both.

# binaries). It is mounted as a per-container named volume, NOT a host bind:
# pushing a multi-GB SQLite/WAL store over the 9p/virtiofs bind risks unreliable
# fcntl locking and corruption, especially if claude-mem ran on the host and in
# the container against the same files at once (see devcontainer.json).
#
# So seed it ONCE, then let the container own its copy. On every later rebuild

# this seed point on; that is the deliberate cost of keeping SQLite off a shared
# bind. To re-seed from the host, remove the volume (`docker volume rm
# claude-mem-<id>`) and rebuild.
#

# of claude-mem.db. Keying on the DB file would be a trap: a multi-GB `cp -r` can

# an interrupted seed leaves no sentinel; the next create clears the half-copied
# store and retries cleanly. CONSISTENCY: copying a live WAL database is only
