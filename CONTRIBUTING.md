# Contributing to GitNexus

How to propose changes, run checks locally, and open pull requests.

## License

This project uses the [PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/). By contributing, you agree your contributions are licensed under the same terms unless stated otherwise.

## Where to discuss

- **Issues & feature ideas:** use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus/issues) for the upstream repo, or your fork’s tracker if you work from a fork.
- **Community:** see the Discord link in the root [README.md](README.md).

## Development setup

**Prerequisites:** Node.js — `gitnexus/` requires `>=22.0.0` and `gitnexus-web/` requires `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0` (enforced via the `engines` field in each package). Use `nvm install` to match the local version.

1. Clone the repository.
2. **CLI / MCP package:** `cd gitnexus && npm install && npm run build`
3. **Web UI (if needed):** `cd gitnexus-web && npm install`
4. Run tests as described in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

### Containerized development (optional)

If you prefer an isolated environment with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and Cursor CLI pre-installed, open the repo in VS Code with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) and run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**. See [`.devcontainer/README.md`](.devcontainer/README.md) for first-time auth flows and Windows WSL2 setup.

## Branch and pull requests

- Use short-lived branches off the default branch of the repo you are targeting.
- **PR titles MUST follow the conventional-commit format** — `pr-labeler.yml` enforces this on every PR and auto-applies the matching label so release notes group the change correctly.
- **PR description:** what changed, why, how to verify (commands), and any risk or rollback notes.

### Pull request titles

Format: `<type>[(scope)][!]: <subject>`

Allowed types and the release-notes section each one lands in (defined in `.github/release.yml`):

| Type               | Label applied   | Release-notes section                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`             | `enhancement`   | 🚀 Features                                                  |
| `fix`              | `bug`           | 🐛 Bug Fixes                                                 |
| `perf`             | `performance`   | 🏎️ Performance                                               |
| `refactor`         | `refactor`      | 🔄 Refactoring                                               |
| `test`             | `test`          | 🧪 Tests                                                     |
| `ci`               | `ci`            | 👷 CI/CD                                                     |
| `build` / `deps`   | `dependencies`  | 📦 Dependencies                                              |
| `docs`             | `documentation` | (grouped under Other Changes unless a Docs section is added) |
| `chore` / `revert` | `chore`         | (excluded from release notes)                                |

Append `!` to the type (e.g. `feat(api)!: drop /v1 endpoint`) or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the PR body to flag a breaking change — the labeler then adds the `breaking` label and the 💥 Breaking Changes section is rendered first.

Examples:

```text
feat(web): add smart chat scroll
fix(extractors): resolve silent contract mis-resolution
perf: avoid O(n²) traversal in heritage walker
chore(deps): bump vitest to 3.0.0
ci: standardize workflow concurrency
```

Commits within a PR may use any style — only the **merged PR title** shows up in release notes, so that's the one the convention applies to.

## Before you open a PR

- [ ] Tests pass for the packages you touched (`gitnexus` and/or `gitnexus-web`).
- [ ] Typecheck passes: `npx tsc --noEmit` in `gitnexus/` and `npx tsc -b --noEmit` in `gitnexus-web/`.
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, or machine-specific paths committed.
- [ ] Documentation updated if behavior or public CLI/MCP contract changes.
- [ ] Pre-commit hook runs clean (`.husky/pre-commit` — formatting via lint-staged + typecheck for staged packages; tests run in CI only).

## Code review

Maintainers may request changes for correctness, tests, performance, or consistency with existing patterns. Keeping diffs focused makes review faster.

## GitHub Actions — Concurrency Convention

Every workflow under `.github/workflows/` MUST declare a top-level `concurrency:` block using this convention:

- **Group key** starts with `${{ github.workflow }}` so no two workflows can collide on the same group name. The discriminator that follows is chosen per event shape:
  - Branch/tag scope: `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}`
  - Per-PR scope (for `issue_comment`, `pull_request_review*`, `pull_request` meta events): `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}`
  - `workflow_run` scope (e.g. `ci-report.yml`): `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.workflow_run.pull_requests[0].number || format('{0}/{1}', github.event.workflow_run.head_repository.full_name, github.event.workflow_run.head_branch) }}` — the fork fallback must be stable across reruns (never `workflow_run.id`, which is per-run-unique and defeats serialization).
  - Global single-slot (manual dispatch utilities): `${{ github.workflow }}`
  - **Reusable workflows invoked via `workflow_call`:** do NOT use `${{ github.workflow }}` in the group key — in called-workflow context its evaluation is ambiguous and can resolve to the caller's name, which would deadlock against the caller's own group. Use a hardcoded literal prefix and a `github.event_name`-aware expression that falls through to `github.run_id` for reusable invocations (see `ci.yml` for the canonical form). Approved literal prefixes: `CI-` (`ci.yml`) and `docker-build-push-` (`docker.yml`). The `check-workflow-concurrency.py` validation script must be updated whenever a new approved literal prefix is added.
  - **Merge queue (`merge_group`)**: when this event is added, use `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.merge_group.head_ref }}` with `cancel-in-progress: false` (every queue entry is a distinct ref; never cancel).
- **`cancel-in-progress` policy:**

  | Event                                    | `cancel-in-progress` | Why                              |
  | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | `pull_request` CI run                    | `true`               | New push supersedes old run      |
  | `push` to `main`                         | `false`              | Every main commit gets validated |
  | Tag push (`v*` publish)                  | `false`              | Never cancel mid-publish         |
  | `push` to `main` for release-candidate   | `false`              | Never cancel mid-RC publish      |
  | `workflow_dispatch` (release/publish)    | `false`              | Manual runs are intentional      |
  | `workflow_run` (sticky-comment reports)  | `false`              | Serialize, don't race            |
  | Per-PR bot workflows (`@claude`, review) | `false`              | Serialize comments per PR        |
  | PR-meta re-checks (pr-description-check) | `true`               | Cheap, latest wins               |
  | Single-slot utilities (triage sweep)     | `true`               | Latest dispatch supersedes       |

- For workflows that serve multiple events at once (e.g. `ci.yml` handles `pull_request`, `push`, and `workflow_call`), make `cancel-in-progress` event-aware:

  ```yaml
  concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
  ```

- When adding a new workflow, copy the concurrency block from an existing workflow of the same event shape.

## CI automation contracts

Two workflows produce machine-readable signals on every PR. Coding agents and humans alike can rely on the names and shapes below — change them with intent.

### `gitnexus/autofix`

`pr-autofix.yml` (untrusted) + `pr-autofix-publish.yml` (trusted) run `prettier --write` and `eslint --fix` against the PR head and surface a single ChatOps button on the PR. Three signals are emitted:

| Surface           | Where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Notes                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sticky PR comment | Top-level comment with the HTML marker `<!-- gitnexus:pr-autofix-summary -->` and heading `## :sparkles: PR Autofix`. Only posted when there is something to fix; clean PRs stay silent.                                                                                                                | Edit-in-place via marker; one comment per PR.                          |
| Fenced JSON block | Inside the sticky, fenced as `gitnexus-autofix`. Schema `gitnexus.pr-autofix/v2` with fields `state` (`fixes-available`), `pr_number`, `head_sha`, `changed_lines`, `run_id`, and `apply_command` (literal `/autofix`). | Parseable signal — preferred over regexing prose. v1 fields preserved as a superset. |
| Check Run         | Stable name `gitnexus/autofix` on the PR head SHA. Conclusion: `success` (clean) or `neutral` (`fixes-available`). The neutral title is `Autofix available — comment /autofix to apply`.                                                                                                                | Surfaced under PR Checks; readable via `gh pr checks <pr>`.            |

To detect outcome from an agent: `gh pr checks <pr> --json name,conclusion,output | jq '.[] | select(.name == "gitnexus/autofix")'`.

Forks are supported. The untrusted half runs fork code with `permissions: {}` and ships the diff as an artifact; the trusted publish job consumes only the diff (data, not code) and posts the comment + check run.

#### Applying autofix

Comment `/autofix` on the PR (whole-line, no arguments). The `pr-autofix-apply.yml` workflow:

1. Validates the comment body matches `^/autofix\s*$` exactly. Quoted or inline mentions are silently ignored.
2. Validates the commenter has `admin`, `write`, or `maintain` permission on the repo, OR is the PR author. Other commenters get a 👎 reaction and a refusal reply.
3. Locates the most recent successful `pr-autofix.yml` run for the PR's current head SHA, downloads its `autofix` artifact, applies the patch, and pushes a `chore(autofix): ...` commit back to the PR head branch.
4. Reacts ✅ on success, 👎 on stale-patch / push-failure, and posts a short reply with the apply-run URL in either case.

The apply workflow runs from the default branch's copy of the file regardless of where the comment originates — that's the trust anchor. There is no diff-size cap (the apply workflow uses `git apply` + push, not the GitHub review-comment API).

For fork PRs, the push succeeds only when the contributor has **Allow edits by maintainers** enabled on the PR (the default). When they have disabled it, the workflow fails loud with a 👎 reaction and an explanation comment.

Re-invoking `/autofix` after a successful apply is a safe no-op — the workflow detects the already-applied state via `git apply --check --reverse` and reacts ✅ without pushing.

**Sensitive paths.** The apply workflow refuses any patch that touches `.github/` (workflow files, CODEOWNERS, dependabot config). A malicious PR could ship a custom prettier or ESLint config that reformats workflow YAML; if accepted, those edits would be pushed under `contents: write` without human review. Apply formatter changes to files under `.github/` manually in a normal commit so they get the same review every other workflow change gets.

### Vendored tree-sitter grammars

`.github/vendored-grammars.json` is the **single source of truth** for the vendored tree-sitter grammar **set** and each grammar's policy `hold` (the ones shipped from `gitnexus/vendor/<name>` rather than installed from npm). It lists each grammar's name, upstream coords (`npm` or `github`), and any `hold`. The monitor resolves upstreams from it; the readiness report keeps its own upstream-drift coords and reads vendored ABIs from `gitnexus/vendor/`. Two workflows read it:

- `grammar-update-monitor.yml` (`.github/scripts/update-vendored-grammars.mjs`) — weekly; opens auto-PRs re-vendoring ABI-compatible upstream updates.
- `tree-sitter-upgrade-readiness.yml` (`.github/scripts/check-tree-sitter-upgrade-readiness.py`) — daily; renders the tree-sitter-0.25 readiness report (issue #858), reading each vendored grammar's ABI from `gitnexus/vendor/<name>/src/parser.c`.

Sharing the manifest keeps the two aligned: a consistency-guard test asserts the manifest set equals the `gitnexus/vendor/tree-sitter-*` directories. **When you vendor a new grammar (or remove one), update `.github/vendored-grammars.json` in the same change** — otherwise that guard fails CI and the readiness report regresses to `?` placeholders.

## AI-assisted contributions

If you use coding agents, follow project context files (e.g. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) and avoid drive-by refactors unrelated to the issue. Prefer incremental, test-backed changes.

## Releases

One workflow ships `gitnexus` to npm — `.github/workflows/publish.yml`. It
routes between two modes based on the triggering event:

- **Stable mode** — triggered by pushing any `v<X.Y.Z>` tag (no `-rc.*`
  suffix; RC tags are excluded at trigger via a negative glob). Publishes to
  the `latest` dist-tag with a changelog-backed GitHub release. Maintainers
  are expected to tag from `main` as a convention; the workflow itself does
  not enforce branch reachability. No Docker build (RC-only). Before cutting a
  stable release, keep `gitnexus/package.json`,
  `gitnexus-claude-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and the matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry in
  lockstep — the always-on `gitnexus` unit suite now fails if those manifest
  versions drift.
- **Release-candidate mode** — runs on every push to `main` (typically a
  merged PR) plus manual `workflow_dispatch`. Docs-only changes are skipped
  via `paths-ignore`. Publishes to the `rc` dist-tag with version
  `X.Y.Z-rc.N` and a GitHub prerelease, where:
  - `X.Y.Z` is selected automatically. On push (and on dispatch with
    `bump: auto`, the default) the workflow **continues the active rc cycle**:
    if the registry already has `X.Y.Z-rc.*` versions with `X.Y.Z` > current
    `latest`, it reuses the highest such base; otherwise it patch-bumps
    from `latest`. Dispatching with `bump: patch|minor|major` **resets**
    the cycle from `latest`.
  - `N` is auto-incremented against existing `X.Y.Z-rc.*` entries on the
    registry. First rc for a given base is `rc.1`.
  - After the npm publish succeeds, the workflow calls `docker.yml` as a
    reusable workflow to build and push the corresponding RC Docker images
    (e.g. `ghcr.io/abhigyanpatwari/gitnexus:1.7.0-rc.1`, mirrored to
    `docker.io/akonlabs/gitnexus:1.7.0-rc.1`). The images are signed
    with Cosign; the OIDC identity is `docker.yml@refs/heads/main` (the
    caller's ref — see README.md § Docker for the verify command).

  Idempotency: the workflow pushes an `rc/<HEAD_SHA>` marker tag and a
  `v<RC>` release tag **atomically, before** calling `npm publish`. The
  RC guard refuses to re-run once the marker exists, so a post-publish
  failure will not mint a duplicate rc for the same commit. The `v<RC>`
  tag points at a detached release commit whose `package.json` matches
  the npm tarball exactly (traceable releases). The RC tag is excluded
  from this workflow's `push: tags:` filter, so it does **not** re-trigger
  publishing — preventing the double-publish failure mode tracked in #1609.
  Recovery after a partial failure: the workflow's `if: failure()` cleanup
  step in the `publish` job auto-deletes the v-tag and marker on most
  post-publish failures, so the typical retry is just:

  ```bash
  gh workflow run publish.yml --ref main -f force=true
  # or push a new commit to main, which will cut a fresh RC
  ```

  If auto-cleanup didn't run (e.g. the cleanup step itself failed, or the
  failure happened in the route/rc-guard phase before the marker was
  pushed), manual cleanup is:

  ```bash
  git push --delete origin rc/<HEAD_SHA> v<RC>
  # then redispatch with force: true
  ```

  **Release-PR-skip subject pattern.** The rc-guard job recognizes a
  squash-merged release commit by matching the commit subject against
  `^chore: release vX.Y.Z` (optionally followed by ` (#NNNN)` for the
  squash-merge PR-number suffix). Match is case-insensitive — `Chore: Release v1.2.3`
  works too. PRs that should suppress the RC build must either use this
  subject shape, or carry the `release` label so the label-based fallback
  fires. Other release-style subjects (`chore(release): v1.2.3`,
  `release: v1.2.3`) will NOT trigger the skip — please name the release
  PR exactly `chore: release vX.Y.Z` to keep the dedup deterministic.

  **Docker-only partial failure:** if `publish` succeeds (npm tarball + tags
  are live) but the `docker` job subsequently fails (e.g. GHCR flakiness),
  the npm RC is already published and the `rc/<HEAD_SHA>` marker is in place.
  Recovery without cutting a new RC:

  ```bash
  # Re-run only the failed docker job from the original workflow run:
  gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
  ```

  Find the run ID via `gh run list --workflow=publish.yml --branch main`.
  `docker.yml` intentionally has no `workflow_dispatch` trigger (images are
  tag-driven by design), so the gh-run-rerun path is the supported recovery.

  **GitHub Release transient failure** (npm publish succeeded, Release step
  failed): the npm artifact is live but no GitHub Release page exists.
  Recover by either re-running the failed job (`gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`),
  or creating the Release manually:

  ```bash
  gh release create v<RC> --prerelease --generate-notes        # RC
  gh release create v<X.Y.Z> --notes-file gitnexus/CHANGELOG.md # stable
  ```

The rc workflow never moves `latest`. To verify after a change, inspect dist-tags:

```bash
npm view gitnexus dist-tags
```
